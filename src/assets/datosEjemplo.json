      "body": "Consider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. A TS file with a component and templateUrl exists\r\n2. The template file does not exist.\r\n3. First build: ngtsc will properly report the error, via a FatalDiagnosticError\r\n4. The template file is now created\r\n5. Second build: ngtsc still reports the same errror.\r\n\r\nNgtsc persists the analysis data of the component and never invalidates it when the template/style\r\nfile becomes available later.\r\n\r\nThis breaks incremental builds and potentially common workflows where resource files are added\r\nlater after the TS file is created. This did surface as an issue in the Angular CLI yet because Webpack \r\nrequires users to re-start the process when a new file is added. With ESBuild this will change and this\r\nalso breaks incremental builds with Bazel/Blaze workers.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we have a few options:\r\n\r\n* Invalidate the analysis when e.g. the template file is missing. Never caching it means that it will be\r\nre-analyzed on every build iteration.\r\n* Add the resource dependency to ngtsc's incremental file graph. ngtsc will then know via `host.getModifiedResources` when the file becomes available- and fresh analysis of component would occur.\r\n\r\nThe first approach is straightforward to implement and was chosen here. The second approach would\r\nallow ngtsc to re-use more of the analysis when we know that e.g. the template file still not there, but it \r\nncreases complexity unnecessarily because there is no **single** obvious resource path for e.g. a `templateUrl`.\r\nThe URL is attempted to be resolved using multiple strategies, such as TS program root dirs, or there is support\r\nfor a custom resolution through `host.resourceNameToFileName`.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to determine some candidate paths and add them to the dependency tracker, but it\r\nseems incomplete given possible external resolvers like `resourceNameToFileName` and also would likely \r\nnot have a sufficient-enough impact given that a broken component decorator is not expected to remain\r\nfor too long between N incremental build iterations.",
